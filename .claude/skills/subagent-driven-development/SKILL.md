# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagents per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance first, then code quality. Independent tasks can run in parallel.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality at scale. Independent tasks parallelize; dependent tasks wait.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Have implementation plan?" [shape=diamond];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" [shape=diamond];
    "Stay in this session?" [shape=diamond];
    "subagent-driven-development" [shape=box];
    "executing-plans or agent team" [shape=box];
    "Write a plan first (writing-plans)" [shape=box];
    "Reconsider plan structure" [shape=box];

    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Tasks mostly independent?" [label="yes"];
    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Write a plan first (writing-plans)" [label="no"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Stay in this session?" [label="yes"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Reconsider plan structure" [label="no - tightly coupled"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "subagent-driven-development" [label="yes"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "executing-plans or agent team" [label="no"];
}
```

**If tasks are tightly coupled** (shared files, shared state, ordering dependencies beyond explicit `Depends on:`), break them into smaller independent units or execute them serially within a single subagent.

## The Process

```dot
digraph process {
    rankdir=TB;

    subgraph cluster_per_task {
        label="Per Task (or per parallel group)";
        "Dispatch implementer subagent" [shape=box];
        "Implementer asks questions?" [shape=diamond];
        "Answer questions, provide context" [shape=box];
        "Implementer implements, tests, commits, self-reviews" [shape=box];
        "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent" [shape=box];
        "Spec compliant?" [shape=diamond];
        "Fix subagent fixes spec gaps" [shape=box];
        "Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent" [shape=box];
        "Quality approved?" [shape=diamond];
        "Fix subagent fixes quality issues" [shape=box];
        "Mark task complete" [shape=box];
    }

    "Read plan, extract tasks, note dependencies, create TodoWrite" [shape=box];
    "More tasks remain?" [shape=diamond];
    "Verify acceptance criteria" [shape=box];
    "Dispatch final code reviewer for entire implementation" [shape=box];
    "Use finishing-a-development-branch" [shape=box style=filled fillcolor=lightgreen];

    "Read plan, extract tasks, note dependencies, create TodoWrite" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent";
    "Dispatch implementer subagent" -> "Implementer asks questions?";
    "Implementer asks questions?" -> "Answer questions, provide context" [label="yes"];
    "Answer questions, provide context" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent";
    "Implementer asks questions?" -> "Implementer implements, tests, commits, self-reviews" [label="no"];
    "Implementer implements, tests, commits, self-reviews" -> "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent";
    "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent" -> "Spec compliant?";
    "Spec compliant?" -> "Fix subagent fixes spec gaps" [label="no"];
    "Fix subagent fixes spec gaps" -> "Dispatch spec reviewer subagent" [label="re-review"];
    "Spec compliant?" -> "Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent" [label="yes"];
    "Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent" -> "Quality approved?";
    "Quality approved?" -> "Fix subagent fixes quality issues" [label="no"];
    "Fix subagent fixes quality issues" -> "Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent" [label="re-review"];
    "Quality approved?" -> "Mark task complete" [label="yes"];
    "Mark task complete" -> "More tasks remain?";
    "More tasks remain?" -> "Dispatch implementer subagent" [label="yes"];
    "More tasks remain?" -> "Verify acceptance criteria" [label="no"];
    "Verify acceptance criteria" -> "Dispatch final code reviewer for entire implementation";
    "Dispatch final code reviewer for entire implementation" -> "Use finishing-a-development-branch";
}
```

### Step by step

1. **Read plan.** Extract all tasks with full text. Note dependencies.
2. **Check task sizing.** Each task should fit ~50% of a subagent's context window. If a task looks too large, break it up before dispatching.
3. **Dispatch task.** Fresh subagent (via Task tool) with full task text and context. For independent tasks, dispatch in parallel. For dependent tasks, wait.
4. **Handle questions.** If the subagent asks questions, answer clearly before letting them proceed.
5. **Spec review.** Dispatch spec compliance reviewer (./spec-reviewer-prompt.md). If issues found, dispatch fix subagent, then re-review.
6. **Quality review.** Dispatch code quality reviewer (./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md). If issues found, dispatch fix subagent, then re-review.
7. **Next task.** Repeat until all tasks complete.
8. **Verify acceptance criteria.** Check the plan's acceptance criteria. Run the tests.
9. **Final review.** Dispatch code reviewer for the entire implementation — catches cross-task integration issues.
10. **Finish.** Use finishing-a-development-branch.

### Parallel dispatch

Independent tasks can be dispatched simultaneously. The per-task review cycle (steps 5-6) runs after each implementer finishes, so reviews can also run in parallel across tasks.

**Guard:** Never parallelize tasks that write to the same files — this is hidden coupling even if tasks aren't marked as dependent.

## Orchestration: Task Tool vs. Agent Teams

**Task tool (default):** Dispatch subagents with Task tool. Controller manages coordination.

**Agent teams (for larger efforts):** Spawn a team with Teammate tool. Create tasks in the shared task list. Teammates claim and execute tasks, coordinating via messages. Controller acts as team lead.

Use agent teams when:
- Multiple plans to execute in sequence
- Want teammates to self-coordinate
- Controller context is getting heavy

## Prompt Templates

- `./implementer-prompt.md` — Dispatch implementer subagent
- `./spec-reviewer-prompt.md` — Dispatch spec compliance reviewer subagent
- `./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md` — Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Read plan: docs/plans/feature-plan.md]
[3 tasks: Task 1 (independent), Task 2 (independent), Task 3 (depends on 1+2)]
[Create TodoWrite with all tasks]

Tasks 1 and 2 are independent — dispatch in parallel:

[Dispatch Task 1 implementer with full task text + context]
[Dispatch Task 2 implementer with full task text + context]

Task 1 implementer: Done. Implemented X, 5/5 tests passing, committed.
Task 2 implementer: "Before I begin — should Y use Z pattern?"
You: "Yes, follow existing pattern in src/z.py"
Task 2 implementer: Done. Implemented Y, 3/3 tests passing, committed.

[Dispatch spec reviewers for both in parallel]
Task 1 spec review: ✅ Spec compliant
Task 2 spec review: ❌ Missing: error handling for edge case

[Dispatch fix subagent for Task 2]
Fix subagent: Added error handling, committed.
[Re-review Task 2]
Task 2 spec review: ✅ Spec compliant

[Dispatch code quality reviewers for both in parallel]
Both: ✅ Approved

[Mark Tasks 1 and 2 complete]

Task 3 depends on 1+2, now unblocked:

[Dispatch Task 3 implementer]
Task 3 implementer: Done. Integration tests passing, committed.

[Spec review → ✅, Quality review → ✅]
[Mark Task 3 complete]

[Verify acceptance criteria from plan header — all pass]
[Dispatch final code reviewer for entire implementation]
Final reviewer: All requirements met, no cross-task issues. Approved.

[Use finishing-a-development-branch]
```

## Trade-offs

**vs. Manual execution:**
- Fresh context per task (no confusion from accumulated state)
- Subagent can ask questions before and during work
- Two-stage review catches issues early

**vs. executing-plans:**
- Same session (no handoff)
- Continuous progress (no waiting for human between batches)
- Review checkpoints automatic
- But: controller context grows as tasks accumulate

**Cost:** Each task costs at minimum 3 subagent invocations (implementer + spec reviewer + quality reviewer), plus fix subagents for review failures and a final whole-implementation reviewer. Catching issues per-task is cheaper than debugging integration problems later.

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
- Skip reviews (spec compliance OR code quality)
- Proceed with unfixed issues
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- Skip scene-setting context (subagent needs to understand where task fits)
- Ignore subagent questions (answer before letting them proceed)
- Accept "close enough" on spec compliance
- Skip review loops (reviewer found issues = fix = review again)
- Let implementer self-review replace actual review (both are needed)
- **Start code quality review before spec compliance is ✅** (wrong order)
- Dispatch dependent tasks before their dependencies complete
- Parallelize tasks that write to the same files (hidden coupling)

**If subagent asks questions:**
- Answer clearly and completely
- Provide additional context if needed
- Don't rush them into implementation

**If reviewer finds issues:**
- Dispatch fix subagent with specific instructions
- Reviewer reviews again
- Repeat until approved

**If subagent fails task:**
- Dispatch fresh fix subagent with specific instructions
- Don't try to fix manually (context pollution)

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **using-git-worktrees** — REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting execution
- **writing-plans** — Creates the plan this skill executes
- **requesting-code-review** — Code review template for reviewer subagents
- **finishing-a-development-branch** — Complete development after all tasks

**Subagents should use:**
- **test-driven-development** — Subagents follow TDD for each task

**Alternative workflows:**
- **executing-plans** — Batch execution in a separate session with human checkpoints
