# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for review. Verify acceptance criteria at the end.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically — identify questions or concerns
3. Note acceptance criteria from plan header
4. If concerns: Raise them before starting
5. If clear: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch
**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report
When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue
Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Verify Acceptance Criteria
After all tasks complete:
- Check each acceptance criterion from the plan header
- Run the tests that verify each condition
- Report: which criteria pass, which fail

### Step 6: Complete Development
After acceptance criteria verified:
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## Agent Teams

For larger efforts or autonomous execution, this skill can be run by a **teammate** rather than in a manual session:

1. Controller spawns teammate using Task tool with `team_name`
2. Teammate loads and executes the plan
3. Teammate reports progress via messages
4. Controller reviews and unblocks as needed

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Step 1 (Review) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking after seeing implementation results

**Don't force through blockers** — stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Verify acceptance criteria after all tasks complete
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting execution
- **writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks

**Alternative workflows:**
- **subagent-driven-development** - Same-session execution with fresh subagents, parallel dispatch, two-stage review
